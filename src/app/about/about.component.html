      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body  ">

      <p class="card-text">Channel 1000 was established in other to combat the menace of
        unemployment and poverty in the country. This conception was instigated owing to a
         close view of Nigerian education
         system vis-a-vis the rate at which universities push these students into Labour market.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


<div class="card text-center" style="font: bold;">
    <div class="card-header text-white  info-color-dark ">
    </div>
    <div class="card-body  ">
      <p class="card-text">An analytical view of our education
        system revealed that Nigeria produces about 300,000 graduates year. Further analysis
         shows that at absorption rate of 20 graduates in a company,
         it would take about 15,000 companies yearly to have these graduates off the street. <br>

         On the contrary, these graduates increase the size of labour
         market on yearly basis as the system has no jobs for them.   </p>

         <div class="card-body  ">
      <p class="card-text">It was on this note that Channel 1000 while having a road map to channel 1000 small businesses into the system on yearly basis to help reduce this stress on the system, also wishes
         to share profit made from other businesses they do with their subscribes.    </p>
    </div>
         <div class="card-body  ">
      <p class="card-text">We also have an affiliate marketing platform where these graduates who wish to work but are unable to get an immediate employment can register. The essence of the registration is to earn while selling companyâ€™s products. This marketing strategy gives these graduates their first marketing experience and repositions them better in the field of marketing. With an
        online sales of 200 items at N1,000 per item, a marketer earnsN40,000.   </p>
    </div>
         <div class="card-body  ">
      <p class="card-text">The aforementioned marketing will not require you to sign a contract and mortgage yourself in any company; rather
         you stay at the convenience of your home and achieve this mile stone.   </p>
         <h4 class="text-danger">This is called social media (e-marketing) marketing.</h4>
